# React Native Template Nativego

## Nativego is react native template for a quick start. 

## ‚û°Ô∏è Dependencies

    npx react-native init <APPLICATION_NAME> --template react-native-template-nativego

### Note on the legacy CLI

There seems to be quite some confusion about the legacy CLI. This template only works with the new CLI. Make sure you have uninstalled the legacy react-native-cli first (npm uninstall -g react-native-cli), for the below command to work. If you wish to not use npx, you can also install the new CLI globally (npm i -g @react-native-community/cli or yarn global add @react-native-community/cli).
